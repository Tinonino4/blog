# Introduction to Spring Boot

Spring Boot is an open-source Java-based framework used to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications. It's designed to simplify the bootstrapping and development of new Spring applications.

## Key Features of Spring Boot

1. **Opinionated Defaults**: Spring Boot comes with a set of opinionated defaults that help you get started quickly.

2. **Embedded Server**: It includes an embedded server (like Tomcat or Jetty) so you can run your application without deploying to an external server.

3. **Auto-configuration**: Spring Boot can automatically configure your application based on the dependencies you've added.

4. **Starter Dependencies**: These are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in your application.

5. **Production-ready Features**: Spring Boot includes features like health checks, metrics, and externalized configuration out of the box.

In the next post, we'll dive deeper into creating your first Spring Boot application. Stay tuned!
